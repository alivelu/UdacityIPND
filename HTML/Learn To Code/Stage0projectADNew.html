<!--To begin adding HTML structure and content, we must first add opening and closing <html> tags.Anything between <html> and </html> will be considered HTML code.-->
<!--Vocabulary in HTML:Angle brackets - The characters < and > are known as angle brackets.HTML element or element is the HTML code that lives inside of angle brackets. Opening tag - the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. Closing tag - the secondng HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside. Except few HTML elements, most elements consist of an opening and closing tag.-->
<head>
<!--By opening a <head> tag or element, we can give some information about the page. The <head> element will contain information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the actual web page.-->

      <b> The World Wide Web </b>
      <!--  <b>text</b> Makes the 'text' content bold-->
      <p>World wide web is a collection of HTML documents.These documents are made up of something called HTML, which stands for HyperTextMarkup Language.HTML glues all sorts of files like documents, images, videos etc.The links between these pages are called Hyper Links.Web was invented in 1990.Main type of document on the web is HTML.All of these things/files like Microsoft word, PDF, Plain Text, music, videos, images exist on the web.</p>
      <!--<p>text</p> Defines a paragraph. The content of the <p> element is in a "box"-->
      <b><em>The major pieces are:</em></b>
      <!--<em>text</em> Makes the 'text' content italic-->
      <ul>
        <!--To create a unordered list using HTML, you can use the <ul> element. The <ul> element cannot hold raw text and cannot automatically format raw text with bullet points. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> element.Unordered list. Ex: grocery list etc.-->
        <li>Person to operate the computer (you/me)</li>
        <li>Computer/Computer running a web broswer like Mozilla Firefox/ Internet Explorer/ Chrome etc.</li>
        <li>The Internet (Which is the world's largest computer network. The internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your broswer and servers.</li>
        <li>Servers</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Browser</em> is a program that runs on <em>computer</em> to display files found on the web.</P>
        <p>Generally the <em>browser</em> makes requests via the <em>internet</em> to <em>servers</em>.</p>
        <p>These requests are using a protocol called <em>http</em> and the <em>servers</em> respond with the files that the <em>browser</em> displays.</p>
        <p><em>Servers</em> are just like <em>computers</em> that host the files that makeup the web.</p>
        <p>The <em>protocol</em> HTTP is a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these <em>servers</em>.</p>

        <p><b>HTML</b> means <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em></p>
        <b>HTML is made up of :</b>
        <ol>
          <!--In ordered lists each list item is numbered. You can create the ordered list with the <ol> element and then add individual list items to the list using <li> elements.-->
          <li>Text content i.e what you see</li>
          <li>Mark up i.e what the content look's like and how it's arranged</li>
          <li>References to other documents ex: images , videos</li>
          <li>It can be made up of Links to other pages</li>
        </ol>
        <b>HTML Mark up</b>
        <p>HTML markup is made up of things called <b>tags</b>.</p>
        <p>Tag is structured like this:</p>
        <p><em>Opening Tag Name.....The Tag Contents(which can be actualy tags or other tags)...... Closing Tag Name</em></p>
        <!--<NAME>         Contents          </NAME>-->
        <!--Opening Tag     Contents         Closing Tag-->
        The whole thing mentioned above is called as an <b>element</b>.
        <p><b>b-Tag</b> means Bold tag</p>
        <p>Structure is like this</p>
        <p><em>opening bold tag ....   Contents..... closing bold tag</em></p>
        <!--<b> Contents </b>-->
        <!--<p>Example:</p>
        <p>HTML is <b>reasonably straightforward</b></p>-->
        <p> Note: The Phrase in between bold tag appears on browser in bold letters</p>
        <p><b><em>em-Tag</em></b> means Emphasis tag (Italics)</p>
        <p>Structure is like this</p>
        <p><em>opening em tag ....   Contents..... closing em tag</em></p>
        <!--<em>     contents     </em>-->
        <!--<p>Example:</p>
        <p>HTML is <em><b>reasonably straightforward</b></em></p>-->
        <p> Note: The Phrase in between em tag appears on browser in bold and italicized letters</p>
        <p>When you forget the closing <b>em tag</b>, Everything after the opening em tag is italicized.</p>
        <!--<p>HTML is <em><b>reasonably straightforward</b>HTML is reasonably straightforward</p>
        <p> Note: The Phrase after em tag is completely italicized.</p>-->
        <b>HTML Attributes:</b>
        <!--<TAG ATTR = "value"> contents </TAG>-->
        <p>Structure is like this</p>
        <p><em>Opening tag---- Attributes always equal to a value-----Closing tag</em></p>
        <p>Tags can have multiple attributes</p>
        <p>An example of a tag that uses an attribute is  a tag or <b>anchor tag</b></p>
        <!--<a href="www.reddit.com"> derp </a>-->
        <p>Structure is like this</p>
        <p><em>opening an attribute name called href=value or url----- derp contents----closing a tag</em></p>
        <!--Make the phrase "my favorite" in the following sentence "This website is my favorite" a link to udacity.com-->
        <!--This website is <a href = "udacity.com"> my favorite </a>-->
        <p>To know more about the anchor tag<a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/485084170923#">Click here</a></p>
        <p>The link opens in the same window</p>
        <p> To open it in a new window the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.</p>

        <p><b>Image Tag:</b></p>
        <p>Structure is like this</p>
        <!--<img src = "url" alt = "text">-->
        <p><em>opening img tag   source= url of the image to downlaod  alt stands for alternate</em>. Text means text that could display when the image doesn't load.image tag is a void tag that means it doesn't have contents</p>
        <p>To view HTML structure as an image</p>
        <img src= "https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/clarkeadv2450/files/2012/08/html-structure.jpg" alt = "Sorry Try Again"/>
        <p><b>br tag</b> is void tag stands for break</br>
          <!--Hello everyone! <br> We're using two lines now!-->
        </br>
        <p>Another way of using line break is <b>p tag</b>. "p" tag stands for paragraph</p>
        <!--<p> contents</p>
        Example:
        <p> Hello everyone!</p><p>We're using two lines now!</p>-->
        <p>Two different ways of making new line are:br tag and p tag</p>
        <p>"br" tag is called as inline and it's just ending a line.Inline elements are just text</p>
        <p>ex: b tag, img tag, em tag</p>
        <p>"p" tag is block i.e it creates invisible box around text contains height and width
          <p>example: p tag </p>
          <b>container elements:</b>
          <p>Elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves. The purpose of these elements will not be clear yet, but in the next lesson you will see how these elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures.</p>
          <p> Ex:Span and Div</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Span</b> is inline element</li>
            <!--<span> text </span>-->
            <li><b>Div</b> is block element</li>
            <!--<div> text </div>-->
          </ul>
          <p>Above are the ways to attach styles to them</p>
          <!--<span class = "foo">
          <div class = "bar">-->
          <p> Span class equals to foo and Div class equals to bar. These are related to css class</p>
          <p>a, span, br, img , strong are <b>inline</b> elements</p>
          <p>while div, p, and form are <b>block</b> elements.</p>

          <p>In HTML particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.Let's look at the above lines of code.</p>
          <p> Note: Please refer to above image.</p>
    </body>
    <!--Closing body tag-->
</html>
<!-- Closing HTML tag-->
<!--Note:If you closely observe above steps you can understand that the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished-->
