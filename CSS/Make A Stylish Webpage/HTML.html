            World wide web is a collection of <span class="italic">HTML</span> documents.These documents are made up of something called <em>HTML</em>, which stands for <em>HyperTextMarkup Language</em>.<em>HTML</em> glues all sorts of files like documents, images, videos etc.The links between these pages are called <em>Hyper Links</em>.Web was invented in 1990.Main type of document on the web is <em>HTML</em>.All of these things/files like Microsoft word, PDF, Plain Text, music, videos, images exist on the web.

          <!--<p>text</p> Defines a paragraph. The content of the <p> element is in a "box"-->
          <span class="italic">The major pieces are:</span>
          <ul>
            <!--To create a unordered list using HTML, you can use the <ul> element. The <ul> element cannot hold raw text and cannot automatically format raw text with bullet points. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> element.Unordered list. Ex: grocery list etc.-->

            <span class="italic">Browser</span> is a program that runs on <span class="italic">computer</span> to display files found on the web.
            Generally the <span class="italic">browser</span> makes requests via the <span class="italic">internet</span> to <span class="italic">servers</span>.
            These requests are using a protocol called <span class="italic">http</span> and the <span class="italic">servers</span> respond with the files that the <span class="italic">browser</span> displays.
            <span class="italic">Servers</span> are just like <span class="italic">computers</span> that host the files that makeup the web.
            The <span class="italic">protocol</span> HTTP is a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these <span class="italic">servers</span>.

            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>
                HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them."br" tag is called as inline and it's just ending a line.<br>
                Inline elements are just text.<br>
                Ex: b tag, img tag, em tag.<br>
                "p" tag is block i.e it creates invisible box around text contains height and width.<br>
                Example: p tag

            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>
                Elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves.
                The purpose of these elements will not be clear yet.
                But in the next lesson you will see how these elements can be used.
                i.e to create web pages with complex structures.<br>
                Ex:Span and Div
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Span</b> is inline element</li>
                <!--<span> text </span>-->
                <li><b>Div</b> is block element</li>
                <!--<div> text </div>-->
              </ul>
              Above are the ways to attach styles to them.
              <p>
                Span class equals to foo and Div class equals to bar. These are related to CSS class.<br>
                &lt;span class = "foo"&gt;<br>
                &lt;div class = "bar";&gt;
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> a, span, br, img , strong are <b>inline</b> elements</li>
                <li>while div, p, and form are <b>block</b> elements.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In HTML particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.
                Let's look at the above lines of code.<br>

            Navigate to Wikipedia web page as it has text, lot of images of different sizes and shapes.
            If you look at the innerstructure of the Google chrome browser page as it has great developer tools.
            Or you van use any other web browser and navigate to Developer tools then an additional panel will open.
            This panel shows the structure of the page.
            In the panel if you move your cursor over lines or elements then you can notice that parts of the webpage get highlighted.
            If you click on triangle in the panel it will expand and gives us a tree like structure.
            A separate panel is also available which is called <em>CSS</em>.
            By observing wikipedia page and structure in panel you can understand the following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>All elements are rectangle</li>
            <li>You can read the same text as on the page</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">
          <h3>Tree like structure:</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Font size and border width can be known by clicking on the lines or elements in panel.<br>
            The important things to know are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>HTML and CSS are both "languages"</li>
            <li>HTML controls the "structure" of a web page</li>
            <li>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When programmers talk about the <em>"DOM" (Document Object Model)</em> they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.
            To learn more about what a "tree-like structure" means, read the first two paragraphs of the wikipedia article on Tree Structures.
            A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
            A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see Tree (data structure) for computer science: insofar as it relates to graph theory, see tree (graph theory), or also tree (set theory).

            <b>HTML</b> : HyperText Markup Language<br>
            The standard markup language used to create web pages.<br>
            <b>CSS</b> : Cascading Style Sheets<br>
            Style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.<br>
            <b>DOM</b> : Document Object Model<br>
            A cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects(Markup languages) in HTML .
            The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Html has specific syntax and rules.</li>
            <li>Basic word in html language is <em>tag</em>.</li>
            <li>The Browser turns html tags into elements that form a tree.</li>
            <li>It knows how to do that because of document model DOM.</li>
            <li>DOM is a standard convention for representing and interacting in HTML.</li>
            <li>So the tree in developer tools in chrome browser is dom tree the browser built from an HTML ducument.</li>
            <li>Each html tag creates an element in DOM that the browser uses to display the page.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            An element is created from starting tag to ending tag and everything in between is <em>content</em>.<br>
            &lt;tag&gt;  content   &lt;/tag&gt;<br>
            Syntax: opening tag     content       closing tag<br>
            The <em>content</em> can be empty, it can be <em>text</em> or <em>element</em>.
            Each tag has a name or type that defines what kind of element will be created.
            I.e will it be a paragraph?, An image?, Or Just a document division..?
            Each tag also can have attributes with values.<br>
            Syntax: &lt;h1 class = "article"&gt;   &lt;/h1&gt;
            <!--   <h1 class = "article">   </h1>   -->
            For example above we have an h1 tag with a class <em>attribute</em> and value of the attribute is <em>article</em>.
            So the document written in HTML defines the structure and content of the page.
