Your project is to create a web page that shows off all the skills you've learned so far! You can make your web page on any topic you'd like.

Project should contain:

An HTML file
A CSS file
Any images or other files that are a part of your web page

All of your styling is done using a separate (linked) CSS file

Your page demonstrates how to use HTML to structure text
Each section should have:
A title that is formatted with a heading element (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)
At least one paragraph of text, enclosed within a paragraph element (<p>)

Your page demonstrates how to use container elements
To be specific:
Your HTML file needs to contain at least 3 <div> container elements.
Each <div> element should contain multiple conceptually related pieces of content (like a title, paragraph, and image that are all about the same thing).
Each <div> element should have a class applied to it.

Your page demonstrates how to use CSS selectors
Hereâ€™s a reminder of what a CSS selector looks like:
p {
}

7. Your page demonstrates use of the class attribute and class selectors
If you want to apply a style to all of a particular kind of elements on your page, you can use an element selector, like the one we just showed above (which applies a style to all <p> elements).
But if you only want to apply a style to certain elements (such as making only some of your <p> elements a particular color), then you can use a class selector. Remember, that looks something like this:
.myclassname {
}

8. Your page demonstrates the use of images
Make sure that:
Your page uses the <img> tag to display at least one image.
The <img> element includes alternative text (using the alt attribute) that describes the image.

our page demonstrates the use of hyperlinks
Make sure that your page uses the <a> element to provide at least one hyperlink to another page.
